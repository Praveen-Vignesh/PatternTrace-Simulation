-- Aim Trainer telemetry schema (v2 — multi-user).
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor (or psql) before starting a session.
--
-- PASTE THIS FILE AS ONE BUFFER — NEVER IN CHUNKS. Postgres runs a
-- multi-statement simple query as a single implicit transaction, so a failure
-- anywhere rolls the whole run back and no intermediate state is ever visible.
-- Split it up and that guarantee is gone. The sharpest edge is the
-- `drop trigger if exists on_auth_user_created` / `create trigger` pair further
-- down: a signup landing between them gets an auth.users row with NO subjects
-- and NO profiles row, after which the client resolves a null subject_id and
-- silently drops every telemetry row that account ever produces — permanently,
-- with no error anywhere. Nothing in this file repairs such a user. That drop
-- also holds ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on auth.users until the run commits, so signups
-- block (they do not fail) for its duration; prefer a low-traffic moment.
-- Afterwards, confirm none were stranded:
--   select u.id, u.email, u.created_at from auth.users u
--     left join public.profiles p on p.user_id = u.id
--    where p.user_id is null;   -- expect zero rows
--
-- Five tables:
--   subjects        — a pseudonymous person. Survives account deletion.
--   profiles        — the link between an auth.users account and a subject.
--                     Deleted with the account, which anonymises the telemetry.
--   sessions        — one timed run: one routine, one difficulty, one hardware
--                     configuration. Pointer lock only pauses it.
--   segments        — one span of play closing with an outcome. The unit the
--                     model consumes.
--   session_metrics — derived aggregates, written offline with the service key.
--
-- Plus v_training_segments, a view (not a table) that the offline pipeline
-- reads with the service key.
--
-- The split exists because hardware and settings are session-scoped, not
-- segment-scoped. Storing dpi/sens/refresh on every segment row would both
-- bloat the table and permit a session whose rows disagree about the DPI.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Legacy — nothing to do here any more
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- v1 stored everything in one flat `telemetry_logs` table whose rows carried no
-- identity at all, so they could never be attached to a subject or mixed into a
-- multi-user training set. That table was renamed `telemetry_logs_v1`, kept as a
-- graveyard for a while, and has since been DROPPED by hand.
--
-- This file therefore no longer renames it or revokes on it. Do not reinstate
-- either statement: `revoke` has no `if exists` form, so a revoke against a
-- table that is gone fails with 42P01 and — because the whole file runs as one
-- implicit transaction — rolls back every other change in the run.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- subjects
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The stable identity every session hangs off. Deliberately NOT auth.users:
-- deleting an account removes the profiles row that maps a person to their
-- subject_id, leaving the telemetry intact but no longer attributable.
--
-- `kind` is the authoritative human/synthetic label, and it lives here rather
-- than on a segment because a client can lie about a row but cannot change its
-- own subject. Synthetic data (a bot driven in a real browser) is kept out of
-- the human set by running it under a subject provisioned with the service key
-- as kind='synthetic' (kind_source='provisioned'), never by trusting a per-row
-- boolean the client controls.
--
-- `kind` is DEFAULT-DENY: a new signup is 'unknown', not 'human'. It used to
-- default to 'human', which meant every stranger who ever signed up entered the
-- training set as a verified human — encoding absence of information as a
-- positive claim, and failing in only one direction (a bot becoming a human,
-- never the reverse), which is the worst direction for a bot detector. Trust is
-- granted here the same way RLS grants it below: explicitly, never by default.
-- 'human' and 'synthetic' are set ONLY by a deliberate service-key write; see
-- the labelling runbook after the constraints.
--
-- Because the training view joins `kind` live rather than stamping it onto each
-- segment row, relabelling is RETROACTIVE: label a subject today and every
-- segment they ever recorded reclassifies with it. That is what makes post-hoc
-- manual labelling correct rather than a workaround.

-- What fetch_telemetry.py should select, so the pipeline never has to join by
-- hand or re-derive the label. `is_human` comes from subjects.kind, which the
-- client cannot write — unlike the v1 per-row boolean, which it could.
-- Service-key reads bypass RLS, so this stays invisible to the browser.
--
-- `is_human` IS THREE-VALUED: true (confirmed human), false (confirmed
-- synthetic), NULL (nobody has labelled this subject). NULL is the default
-- state of every public signup and MUST be filtered out before fitting —
-- `where is_human is not null` — never coerced or imputed. A boolean CLI flag
-- cannot express that filter, so the pipeline needs a three-state option.
-- subject_kind_source is the audit column: once
-- subjects_label_has_provenance is validated, `is_human is not null` already
-- implies a deliberate label, so adding
-- `and subject_kind_source in ('provisioned','reviewed')` should never change
-- the row count — if it does, that constraint was never promoted.
--
-- security_invoker so the view runs with the caller's privileges, not the
-- owner's. The real protection is the revoke below (only the service key, which
-- bypasses RLS, can read it); security_invoker removes the footgun where a
-- single future GRANT would otherwise expose every subject's trajectories
-- through an owner-privileged view.
--
-- subject_id is the CANONICAL identity: merged duplicates collapse onto their
-- survivor via merged_into, so this is the correct grouping key for a
-- train/test split. raw_subject_id keeps the un-collapsed value for auditing a
-- merge. Collapsing here means a later merge is a single UPDATE with zero
-- pipeline changes.
--
-- Dropped and recreated rather than CREATE OR REPLACE: replace can only append
-- columns to the end of an existing view, and this revision both changes the
-- is_human expression and inserts the provenance columns mid-list, which
-- replace rejects. The view holds no data, so dropping it is free.
